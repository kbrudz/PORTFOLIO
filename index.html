                <h2>I am currently working at ABB, where I apply my skills and knowledge in automation,
                    robotics, electronics, and programming. In October, I earned my Master’s degree
                    by defending my thesis, "Dysarthria Recognition Using Machine Learning Methods", 
                    which focused on applying deep learning techniques for automatic speech disorder recognition. 
                    My background combines expertise in cyber-physical systems, machine learning, and industrial process optimization.
                    
                    <p> Outside of academic pursuits, I am passionate about playing squash, which allows me to have an active break and maintain 
                        a balance between work and personal life. I also enjoy spending time watching movies and series, as well as reading books, 
                        which allows me to pursue interests beyond the world of technology.

                    <p> 
                        In my role, I supported the industrialization process of electronic products, with a specific focus on smart sensors designed for motor applications. 
                        My responsibilities included preparing tests, conducting them, and creating user manuals for the devices. Additionally, 
                        I was involved in troubleshooting issues with malfunctioning devices, utilizing both hardware and software approaches to identify the root causes of faults. 
                        My work also involved documenting processes and collaborating with the team to optimize product efficiency and quality. </p>

                    <p> 
                        As a Trainee in the Certification Department at Green Cell, my primary role involved preparing documentation necessary for the certification of electronic 
                        devices in the EU and the United States. These devices included power banks and electric vehicle chargers, among others. A thorough understanding of relevant 
                        standards and regulations was essential to ensure compliance with certification requirements. My responsibilities included compiling technical documentation, 
                        coordinating with regulatory bodies, and facilitating the certification process. Additionally, I conducted research to stay updated on evolving regulations 
                        and standards in the industry. </p>
